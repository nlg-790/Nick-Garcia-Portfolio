            <h3>Food Wellness Hub</h3>
            <p class="project-description">This was my first Capstone project at Springboard. As I said in my About page, the internet is a form of reality. Furthermore, health and wellness is also a form of reality. So, I decided to combine the two integral parts of life in one site. The technologies that were used were HTML, CSS, Python, Flask, PIP, Render, Virtual Environment and API.   </p>

            <h3>The Cat Interface</h3>
            <p class="project-description">My second Capstone project. Here, I used a lot more technologies such as React, Node and JSON along with HTML, CSS and Javascript. I decided to make a single place for cats since the internet loves cats so much. </p>

            <h3>Jeopardy</h3>
            <p class="project-description">One of my assignments for Springboard. This is the first time I used APIs. This was challenging because of having to work with outside code that is not mine and incorporating it into my code. But, it turned out to be very rewarding since I now created my own game.</p>

            <h3>Pokemon</h3>
            <p class="project-description">Here is a passion project of mine that I made post Springboard. As a lifelong Pokemon fan I was tempted to make a Pokemon site since I learned that there is a Pokemon API</p>
