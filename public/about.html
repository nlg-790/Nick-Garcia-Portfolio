    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is Nicholas Garcia, but you can call me Nick. I'm a certified Web Developer based out of New Jersey who is a graduate of the Springboard Software Engineering program. I make sites that I began my adult life studying Business Administration and earning my Associate of Arts in Business Administration and Management from Brookdale Community College followed by earning my Bachelor of Arts in Communication from Monmouth University. Following college, I worked in administration working across many departments and being exposed to many specialties and walks of life. However, I still did not know what my true calling was. Therefore, I seeked guidance from a career coach. When I explained my circumstances and my life story, she recommended that I try coding since I alawys loved tech and since the internet is a major form of reality that will always create jobs. And this is what led me to join Springboard, which is an online coding bootcamp based out of San Francisco that is nationally renowned, where graduates have gone on to work at companies such as Amazon, Google, and any other major firm you can think of. When I was at Springboard, I learned that my passion is to make websites that belong on the internet that help people, that anyone can have fun with, and sites that are integral to the realities of the internet that transfer over into the realities of everyday life.</p>
